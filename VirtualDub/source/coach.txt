"You are about to save an uncompressed AVI file, which may be VERY large. "
"If this is not a temporary AVI file, consider using video compression to "
"save space.  The video mode must be set to Full Processing Mode for "
"video compression to work."

"You have selected a video compressor, but the video mode is set to "
"Direct Stream Copy.  Video compression is not active in Direct Stream Copy "
"mode."
,

// 2
"You are using an outdated video compression codec.  Consider using a newer codec "
"such as Indeo 4.x/5.x or MPEG-4 for higher quality and smaller "
"files."

"You have selected an audio compressor, but the audio mode is set to "
"Direct Stream Copy.  The audio mode must be set to Full Processing Mode "
"to enable audio compression. "
,

"Filters cannot be used if the video mode is not set to Full Processing Mode."
,

// 5
"Video compression is enabled, but no audio compression has been selected. "
"The high-quality uncompressed audio might take up a lot of space.  Consider "
"using audio compression or a lower quality audio format to shrink the "
"final output."
,

"Video compression quality is set higher than 90%.  This can result in very "
"large AVI files.  Reducing quality below 90% may shrink the output file with "
"little visible difference."
,

// 7
"No keyframe interval has been set.  Players will take a LONG time to fast-forward "
"or rewind within the output file."
,

// 8
"Output color depth has been set to 16-bit.  Setting the output to 24-bit "
"will probably result in higher quality output. "
,

// 9
"Audio interleaving is off.  This can shrink output files a tiny bit, but will "
"degrade playback performance."
,

// 10
"Fast Repack mode is selected.  This can significantly speed up recompression times, "
"but may cause errors with codecs that do not properly support YUV formats.  Check "
"your output file to make sure the input and output codecs are compatible."
,

// 11
"You are trying to compress with a hacked compression driver.  This may cause VirtualDub "
"to act or crash unexpectedly.  Proceed at your own risk."

// 12
"Microsoft does not want MPEG-4 V3 to be used in AVI files.  Windows Media Player will "
"refuse to play the output file, and other applications may receive strange compression errors."
