Hello.

If you're seeing this, it means you've unpacked the VirtualDub source code
and have loaded it into Visual C++.  You're looking at the workspace
pretty much as I saw it when I hit F7 to build the archive.

So now, to build:

0) Make sure you have NekoAmp and Sylia unpacked and built already.  It's
   a lot easier if the NekoAmp (amplib_new\) and sylia\ directories are
   parallel to VirtualDub\.  You also *must* have at least Visual C++
   6.0 Service Pack 3; VC5 does not support MMX and unpatched VC6
   introduces code generation errors into the resize filter.

1) Change the current project from Distribution.  You'll need to build
   the vdremote and vdsvrlnk projects first to get VirtualDub itself to
   build.

2) Nuke the pre-build and post-build steps for VirtualDub.exe for both
   Debug and Release builds.  This will kill the errors that you'd other-
   wise get for not having the verinc and mapconv tools.

3) Check the import library paths for VirtualDub.exe, vdremote.dll, and
   vdsvrlnk.dll and make sure they point to the correct locations.

4) Build vdsvrlnk first, then vdremote, then VirtualDub.  If all goes
   well, you'll have a working executable!

If you're getting a lot of missing include files, make sure the source
zip files were correctly unzipped (i.e. with directories).

If you're getting "can't find ML.EXE", you're missing MASM 6.14.  You
can get around this by installing the Debug and Release OBJ files from
the auxiliary source archive and killing the custom build rules from
the ASM files in the project.
