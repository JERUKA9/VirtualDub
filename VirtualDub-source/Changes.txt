Build 10805 (Version 1.3d):
   [thanks to Microsoft]
   * Support for ASF and MPEG-4 V3 has been removed at the
     request of Microsoft.  I can't tell you how disappointed
     I am at this, but Microsoft says they have intellectual
     property rights, and I can't do anything about it.
     This makes me very sad.

   [features added]
   * Added Matrox dmb1 to motion-JPEG detection.

   [optimizations]

     this should improve file switching performance in

   * VirtualDub's internal YUY2 driver doesn't show up in
     the compression dialog after capture mode anymore.

Build 9924 (Version 1.3):
   [misc changes]
   * Inverse telecine has been disabled.  It's not working
     nearly as well on various sources as I'd hoped, and so
     I've disabled it until I have time to fix it.

   [features added: main program]
   * Direct support for YUY2 in both processing and capture
     modes.
   * VirtualDub can now detect when files are about to
     exceed available disk space and/or the 4Gb FAT32 limit,
     and close the file before the limit.
   * Replaced puny OS audio compression dialog with better,
     BIGGER one.

	 seem to have.
   * Finally implemented Abort button in the load progress
     boxes.

	 abort-on-right.  (Abort-on-left catches the OK click.)
   * Most-recently-used list on menu now updates correctly
     when file loads fail.
   * ASF frame timing algorithm changed again; this one
     should avoid the 800,000 ms audio errors that sometimes

     allows compensation for bad audio clock.
   * Audio conversion dialog now allows arbitrary sampling
     rates (such as 22047).

   [optimizations]
   * MMX version of precise resize filters sped up
     slightly.
   * Tweaked bicubic mode of resize filter from A=-1.0 to

     be done in Direct Stream Copy mode.
   * 2 gigabyte barrier broken!  VirtualDub now supports
     the OpenDML 1.02 (AVI 2.0) extensions, meaning
     capture and processing to >2Gb files is now
     possible.
   * 'Save striped master' greatly speeds up making audio
     master tracks for using frameservers with the VCM
     driver.
   * Built-in MJPEG support -- it's incredibly slow, but

     optimized.
   * 16-bit RGB MPEG decoding.

   [bug fixes]

   [Features added]
   * Striped AVI output mode for higher performance and
     evading the 2Gb limit.
   * Scene forward/reverse.
   * Histogram works on cards with hardware decompression.
   * VCM frameclient driver + support; now XingMPEG Encoder
     can use frameservers.
   * MPEGs can have their P/B frames omitted and/or motion
     vectors truncated to full pels for performance.
   * AVI rekeying, to fix AVIs with bad keyframe flags.
   * Task priority and filename extension behavior
     configurable.

   * Double-clicking on a filter entry brings up the
     configure dialog box for that filter.

   [bug fixes]
   * Frameserver setup no longer says 'Korin.'
   * AVI output routines fixed - no longer writes odd-byte
     chunks.
   * Potential crash/hang problems with y-values in the
     fill filter fixed.
   * Filter entries now highlighted after an Add.

Build 2769 (Public Release 2):
   [Features added - main program]
   * Preliminary MPEG support (video only).
   * Histogram support. Click on the histograms to cycle
     between R/G/B/I modes.
   * Dubbing and capture windows now show filename.
   * Support for compressed 8-bit AVI files.
   * Audio compression and decompression.
   * Left, right arrow keys fine-step frames.
   * New output mode: individual DIB frames.
   * Context help for all capture and some dub dialogs.
   * Frameserver mode, to serve processed video output to
     other applications in real-time.
   * Vertical flip filter.
   * MRU (Most recently used) list.
   * Interleaving options now work.

   [Features added - capture]
   * Capture mode now has accelerators.
   * Total size during internal capture.
   * Histogram works on capture cards that use hardware
     compression.
   * Capture file, driver, and settings can be saved.

   [optimizations]
   * Larger granularity for index blocks.
   * Resize filter heavily optimized for FPU - linear
     interpolation now runs at full speed on many AVIs,
     without an MMX CPU.
   * Slightly better interface performance under NT.
   * Output buffering works now.
   * Internal capture mode - much better capture
     performance.

   [bug fixes]
   * Output file properly closed upon write failures.
   * Audio offset/clipping parameters fixed for frame rate
     decimation.
   * WAV files now closed when disabled.
   * Time limit for captures fixed; no longer alters the
     audio buffer size.
   * Conversion routines fixed for odd AVI widths; solves
     crash problems on many AVIs, particularly in 16-bit
     decompression mode.
   * ICDecompress() now used with decompressors that do
     not support ICDecompressEx().  This allows the
     miroVideo DRX MJPEG decompressor to work with
     VirtualDub.
   * Titlebars no longer refreshed every 1/2 second
     unless necessary -- speeds up dubs on slow systems.
   * Problems with audio-less files fixed.
   * Fixed range dialog from 'locking' when length(ms)
     field cleared.
   * Dynamic compilation filters work under NT.
   * Fixed corruption/crash problems with convolution
     based filters.
   * Failed captures and dubs are still finalized.
   * Memory leaks with filter system solved.
   * Capture errors forced to foreground.

Build 1482 (Public Release 1):
   * Marking works.
   * Frame reset to 0 upon load.
   * Position control.
   * Rounding/overflow errors in clipping dialog gone.
   * 8-bit AVIs now supported.
   * End-of-file race condition fixed.
   * AVI length write fixed
     (NOTE: If you have files which give errors at the end
            of processing, trim the end back and turn on
	    Audio clipping.)
   * Audio interleaving fixed.
   * Preview mode audio playback no longer cut off.
   * Miscellaneous bug fixes.
