Build 32593 (1.9.5, stable): [August 22, 2009]
   [bugs fixed]
   * UI: Panes didn't always auto-refresh immediately after choosing some menu
     items.
   * UI: Fixed output pane changing aspect ratio when window is minimized.
   * Fixed blank dialog system icon in cropping dialog.
   * Render: Importing an MP3 audio stream with a partial final audio frame
     could result in a silent error at the end of a save/export.
   * Capture: Added missing "No drivers found" item to audio menu if no
     capture device is connected at startup.
   * Filters: The filter system now initially tries converting NV12 to YV12
     before trying YV24.
   * JobControl: Fixed repeated flushing of job file in non-distributed mode.
   * Fixed crash when creating animated GIF from 8-bit video.
   * Reversed order of UV planes for YV16 and YV24 formats to match YV12.
     (Note: This does not affect filters.)

   [regressions fixed]
   * Output panes don't update during scene stepping again (broken in 1.9.4).
   * Input preview forces on the input pane again (broken in 1.9.1).
