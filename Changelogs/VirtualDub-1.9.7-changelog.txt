Build 32661 (1.9.7, stable): [October 18, 2009]
   [bugs fixed]
   * AVI: Modified indexing traversal to handle deeply nested hierarchical
     indices.
   * Filters: Rescaling after changes to filter chain now extends or trims
     ending ranges as needed to match changes to frame count.
   * Filters: Fixed bug where a filter capable of both 3D accelerated and
     unaccelerated modes (resize) could force a conversion to YV24 at its
     input when RGB32 was a better match.
   * Filters: Filter preview no longer always runs the filter chain with the
     input video mode set to default.
   * Display: Added workaround for video card/driver combos that perform
     extremely poorly with DirectDraw/Direct3D blits overlapping a secondary
     monitor. This can be toggled in Options > Preferences > Display.
   * Command line: The warning dialog at the end of command line processing is
     now suppressed if /x is specified.

   [regressions fixed]
   * Filters: Fixed filter errors not showing up properly.
   * Filters: Fixed crash when PNG decoding error occurs with logo filter.
   * Filters: Fixed random crash when opening Video Filters dialog before
     opening any videos.
