Build 32706 (1.9.8, stable): [December 24, 2009]
   [bugs fixed]
   * Fixed occasional hang with certain conversion paths from 8-bit (256
     color) to YCbCr formats.
   * Fixed bug where two curve points on top of each other in the curve editor
     didn't save properly in script files.
   * Fixed decompression error in IFF ANIM decoder when entire bitplanes were
     skipped.
   * Filters: Fixed glitches in IVTC pattern in the first five frames of
     video.
   * Filters: Fixed occasional crash when 3D acceleration is enabled and the
     3D device is lost.
   * Filters: Fixed bugs where the curve display would either show the wrong
     frames or fail to step in certain circumstances.
   * Filters: Blends are no longer allowed on filters where the input and
     output have different formats; this didn't work and produced a corrupted
     image.
   * Filters: Fixed crash in smoother filter with MMX disabled.
   * Decoders: Fixed crash in Motion JPEG decoder on certain kinds of corrupt
     data.
   * Frameserver: Fixed random crash issue related to stream format structure.
   * Hex editor: Fixed bug where 'O' and 'S' activated open and save commands
     instead of Ctrl+O and Ctrl+S.
