   [features added]
   * The log now indicates which plugins failed to load on startup.

   [bugs fixed]
   * UI: Fixed a case where the output pane could change aspect ratio when
     auto pane sizing was enabled and the main frame window was resized.
   * UI: The output pane now has the correct pixel aspect ratio when an input
     plugin indicates non-square pixels and no filters are used.
   * UI: 6% zoom menu items didn't display checkmarks properly.
   * AVI: Fixed incorrect decoding of paletted video files when biClrUsed=0 in
     the header and the input color mode is set to Autoselect.
   * AMD64: Fixed incorrect disassembler module in crash handler.
   * Render: Fixed sporadic hang when using smart rendering with fast
     recompress mode.
   * Render: Audio is no longer cut off when "cut off when video ends" option
     is disabled and IVTC filter is used.
   * Filters: Fixed duplicate frame fetches when using lagged filters (ex:
     temporal smoother) at the very end of the source video stream.
   * Filters: Fixed frame fetch errors when using filters with a frame window
     (ex: interpolate) at the end of an MPEG-1 video.
   * Filters: Source length was not set during renders.
   * Filters: Fixed garbage line at bottom of frame when using IVTC filter
     with an odd height.
   * Filters: Fixed bug where filter preview stopped displaying frames past a
     certain point when edits had occurred on the timeline.
   * Batch: Timeline had wrong frame counts when creating batch jobs via
     Process Directory or Batch Wizard with a frame rate changing filter (ex:
     IVTC).
   * Decoders: Fixed decoding of Huffyuv files using median prediction and
     4:2:0 encoding.
   * Decoders: Fixed incorrect chroma DC handling with restart markers in
     MJPEG decoder.
