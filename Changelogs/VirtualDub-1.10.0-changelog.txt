   [bugs fixed]
   * Reduced priority of ASF pseudo-handler to avoid interfering with input
     handlers that detect by filename.
   * AVI: The preferred handler (fccHandler) field in the video stream is now
     ignored by default for consistency (unless re-enabled in preferences).
   * UI: Limit minimum window size to avoid caption redraw artifacts.
   * UI: Fixed bug where aspect ratio of panes in unconstrained aspect mode
     would drift when auto-sizing was enabled.
   * UI: Select Range command is now disabled when no video is loaded.
   * UI: Audio conversion dialog no longer occasionally says "No change
     (8-bit)" for compressed formats; this was sometimes incorrect as when
     that option was selected the pipeline actually used what the codec
     produced, which was usually 16-bit.

     last selected codec.

     longer lose focus when clicked.

     control windows.

     planned shutdown on server versions of Windows.

     properly.
   * Images: Fixed GIF autodetect code checking the footer instead of the
     header.

   * Filters: Switched the frame that the IVTC filter drops in reduce frame
     rate mode to match the old pre-filter algorithm.
   * Filters: Cropping dialog now opens at the currently selected frame.
   * Filters: Fixed warp sharp filter in 3D acceleration mode.
