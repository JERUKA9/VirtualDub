Build 32618 (1.9.6, stable): [September 19, 2009]
   [bugs fixed]
   * Images: Fixed bug where the PNG encoder would randomly produce invalid
     encoded images.
   * Scripts: Fixed memory read crash when attempting to open a file with
     percent signs. 

   [regressions fixed]
   * Retweaked MP3 CBR rate determination.
   * Fixed rare crash when stopping a scene shuttle operation.
   * AVI: 1GB option was broken for normal save operations (although it did
     work for capture mode).
   * Filters: Shift+Mouse color checking in preview windows works again (broken
     in 1.9.2).
   * Filters: Fixed incorrect frame being sampled after edits were done on the
     timeline.
   * UI: Removed "run as job" check box from Save Image Sequence dialog, since
     it's now redundant with the "queue batch operation" command.
